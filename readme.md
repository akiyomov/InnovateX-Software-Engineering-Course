# Assignment Submission for InnovateX Team

Welcome to the main branch of the InnovateX team's repository for the Software Engineering course. This README provides guidance on how to view and submit assignments for our team.

## Viewing Assignments

To view assignments, navigate through the branches of this repository. Each branch corresponds to a specific assignment or task completed by team members. Follow these steps:

1. **Switch Branches**: On the main page of the repository, find the branch dropdown menu. It's usually located at the top-left, above the file list.
2. **Select a Branch**: Choose the branch that corresponds to the assignment you wish to view. Each branch is named according to the assignment it represents.

## Submitting Assignments

Assignments should be submitted through their respective branches. If you're completing an assignment, make sure to follow these steps:

1. **Create or Checkout a Branch**: If you're starting a new assignment, create a new branch with a clear name related to the assignment and include your student ID. If the branch already exists, checkout to it.
2. **Add Your Work**: Commit your work to the branch. Ensure your files are properly named and organized according to the assignment requirements.
3. **Push Changes**: Push your commits to the repository. Make sure to push them to the correct branch.
4. **Open a Pull Request**: Once your work is ready and pushed, open a pull request for your branch against the main branch. This will signal the team leads to review your work.

## Guidelines

- **Naming Convention**: Use meaningful names for branches and commits. For branches, use a format like `assignment-<name>-<studentID>` or `task-<name>-<studentID>`.
- **Documentation**: Include a README file in your branch with a brief explanation of the assignment and how to run any code if applicable.
- **Code Quality**: Ensure your code is clean, well-commented, and adheres to the course's coding standards.

## Support

For questions or assistance, reach out to the team leads or use the repository's Issues section to seek help.
